## Usage

When starting a new project, delete the `_template` folder. It is used to hold meta files for this README and the CSS theme demonstration files.

You can also delete any of the files under `assets/images` that you aren't using, and the files under `assets/css/theme` if you're not using the built-in theme.

## File structure

Project follows a clean standard for a standalone web page. See screenshot below for an example of the folder structure.

## CSS Themes

Project now has built-in dark and light themes. To see a demonstration of them in action, have a look at the page found under `_template/demo.html`  

### Usage

To use the built-in themes, include the `base.css` file found in `assets/css/theme`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/theme/base.css" />
```

To use prebuilt button styles, also include `assets/css/theme/buttons.css`. This must come after `main.css` in the stylesheet order.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/theme/buttons.css" />
```
